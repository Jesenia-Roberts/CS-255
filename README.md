* Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a web-based application requested by a small business. The goal was to create a system that would allow students to better prepare for their driving test by allowing students to take practice tests and make reservations for driving practice. 
* What did you do particularly well?
One thing I thought that I did particularly well was the business document. I put a lot of effort into it, and feel that the work reflected it.
* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one thing it would be the diagrams, I would have had a more cohesive design throughout all of the UML diagrams that I created.
* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user’s needs were at the forefront of the design process as for every requirements section and diagram I had to think about what the user had to be able to do. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing as it prevents tunnel vision and allows the programmer to step outside of themselves when designing the application.
* How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In the future I can see myself using the class diagrams the most. Especially when working with a team it makes the overall purpose of the code significantly more clear. Although each diagram we learned has a use in the design process, I found the class diagram to be the most useful.
